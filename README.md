earthbound background generator (processing(aka java) editionâ„¢)
<br><br>
### What's this? <br>
a program in which you can make earthbound-styled backgrounds <br>
<br>
if there are any bugs, please make an issue about it, thanks <br>
### Read this before downloading!
This program was made in [Processing 4](https://processing.org/), so it needs [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/) for it to work*. <br>
*(ignore this if you want to get the OpenJDK-included version!)
## If you want to get a release and you're not on Windows,
it is recommended to get the source code, download Processing 4 (link above) and compile it yourself.
